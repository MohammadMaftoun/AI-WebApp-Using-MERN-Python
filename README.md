# AI-WebApp-Using-MERN-Python

A full-stack web application integrating AI capabilities using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) and Python. This repository demonstrates deploying a machine learning model in a web application with seamless communication between the frontend, backend, and AI model server.

# Features

    AI Integration: Deploy Python-based AI/ML models with Flask or FastAPI.
    MERN Stack: Build a dynamic and scalable web interface with React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
    API Communication: Enable secure communication between the web server and the AI server.
    Containerization: Simplify deployment with Docker and Docker Compose.
    Responsive Design: Frontend built with React for an interactive user experience.

# Example Use Case

Sentiment Analysis Web App
In a web application where users can input text, the AI model predicts the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral).

    Frontend: Users enter text through a React-based interface.
    Backend: The Node.js/Express server handles user requests and forwards them to the AI server.
    AI Server: A Python-based sentiment analysis model (trained using libraries like scikit-learn or transformers) processes the input and returns predictions.
    Database: MongoDB stores user inputs and their associated results for analytics.

# Technologies Used

    Frontend: React.js, Axios
    Backend: Node.js, Express.js, Mongoose
    Database: MongoDB
    AI Model: Python, Flask/FastAPI, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, or PyTorch
    Containerization: Docker, Docker Compose
